An app that lets you add drops of things you want to do in your life to a bucket. Wait a second? Is that a to do list? God forbid no, its not. Its an app that lets you set some goals in your life that you wanna do perhaps 4 years down the line, it doesnt bug asking specific timings, just wants to know when you think would be a a great time by which you wanna get something done.

<h3>How to use it</h3>
Add a drop where you tell what you wanna do and by when and guess what? BAM. It keeps track of it and only notifies you when you are 10% away from the date you wanna do it.
